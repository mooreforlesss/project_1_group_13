# project_1_group_13
This project is to demonstrate data cleaning, data analysis and data presentation skills to show the team grasped the concepts provided the past 6 weeks from the Data analysis and Visualization Certification Course. We chose the dog biting dataset because we found a common interest of dogs and all own dogs. We as well hoped this presentation educated others on the importance of proper data collection as well as data visualization techniques.
The Scope was limited to analysis on a CSV dataset; no more than 10MB of data. A minimum of three research questions were answered including inspiration as we built upon previous topics. The dataset chosen came from Kaggle.com as Kaggle has a wealth of data and previous analysis to build upon. The dataset could come from other sources if needed.. Five visualizations were included, extra visualizations out of scope, yet will be considered. The visualizations included Bar charts, line graphs, pie charts (donut) as well as other useful visualizations to accommodate proper presentation of the distribution, spread, min, max, mean, median and mode of the data. Roles and responsibilities were initially defined and presented in the project proposal with modifications as needed throughout the project.
